# Flight Search 

To practice the concepts I learned in Unit 6 of [Android Basics with Compose](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-compose/course), including SQL, Room, and DataStore, I built this Android app that asks the user for a departure airport, searches a pre-populated database to present a list of flights that depart from that airport, lets the user save favorite flights, and updates the database with Room.
